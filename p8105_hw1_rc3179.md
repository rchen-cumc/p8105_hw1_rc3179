# Problem 1

Creating a data frame with random sample of size 8 from a standard
Normal distribution, logical vector indicating whether elements of the
sample are greater than 0, character vector of length 8, factor vector
of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels” Code chunk with messages
off

``` r
library(tidyverse)
p1_df = tibble (
  sample = rnorm(8),
  logic_vect = sample > 0,
  char_vect = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h"),
  factor_vect = factor(c("low","medium","high","low","medium","high","low","medium"))
)
```

Attempting to take the mean of each type of vector:

The mean of numeric vector sample is 0.1331489

The mean of logical vector logic\_vect is 0.5

The mean of character vector char\_vect is NA

The mean of factor vector factor\_vect is NA

Mean works for numeric and logical vectors but not for charactor or
factor vectors, which returns NA instead

Code chunk to convert logical, character, and factor variables to
numeric (code chunk shown but no results)

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, logic_vect))
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, char_vect))
as.numeric(pull(p1_df, factor_vect))
```

Logical vectors convert to 0s and 1s, character vectors throw an error
and instead returns NA, and factor vectors convert to numbers for the
various ‘levels’ (in this case 1, 2,
    3)

``` r
pull(p1_df, sample)*as.numeric(pull(p1_df, logic_vect))
```

    ## [1] 0.0000000 0.4807834 0.9671196 0.0000000 0.4053170 0.0000000 0.0000000
    ## [8] 1.3423672

``` r
pull(p1_df, sample)*as.factor(pull(p1_df, logic_vect))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(pull(p1_df, sample), as.factor(pull(p1_df,
    ## logic_vect))): '*' not meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
pull(p1_df, sample)*as.numeric(as.factor((pull(p1_df, logic_vect))))
```

    ## [1] -0.2032700  0.9615668  1.9342392 -0.3030668  0.8106339 -0.2061912
    ## [7] -1.4178676  2.6847344
